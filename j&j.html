            How Well the Vaccine Works
        </h2>
        <ul class="detail">
            <li>
                The J&J/Janssen vaccine was 66.3% effective in clinical trials (efficacy) at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people who had no evidence of prior infection 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine. People had the most protection 2 weeks after getting vaccinated.    
            </li>
            <li>
                The vaccine had high efficacy at preventing hospitalization and death in people who did get sick. No one who got COVID-19 at least 4 weeks after receiving the J&J/Janssen vaccine had to be hospitalized.
            </li>

            <li>
                Early evidence suggests that the J&J/Janssen vaccine might provide protection against asymptomatic infection, which is when a person is infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 but does not get sick.
            </li>
<li>
    CDC will continue to provide updates as we learn more about how well the J&J/Janssen vaccine works in real-world conditions.
